# Wastewater Genomics Syndicate Documentation

Welcome to the documentation page of the Wastewater Genomics Syndicate, housed at the National Institute for Communicable Diseasesâ€™ Centre for Vaccines and Immunology (CVI) in South Africa. Our syndicate is dedicated to the surveillance of diverse pathogens, such as SARS-Cov-2, measles, rubella, hepatitis A, hepatitis E, polio, influenza A, and influenza B. We employ wastewater-based epidemiology and cutting-edge genomic techniques to monitor and analyze these pathogens.

## Surveillance and Data Collection

Our comprehensive surveillance initiative extends beyond wastewater monitoring. We also collect clinical data from patients in selected reference hospitals, creating a robust dataset for a holistic understanding of pathogen trends.

## Valuable Resource for Information

The information generated through our surveillance program is a valuable resource, providing regular updates on the trends and impact associated with the monitored pathogens. These updates are crucial for public awareness, guiding the broader medical community, assisting healthcare practitioners, and informing policymakers.

## Public Accessibility

To enhance transparency and dissemination, the updates from our surveillance program are made accessible to the public. This inclusive approach ensures that the information reaches a wide audience, fostering a collaborative effort to combat communicable diseases.

## Documentation Purpose

This documentation page serves as a comprehensive reference guide. It outlines the procedures for conducting analyses that are routinely performed in our reporting and publications. Whether you are a researcher, healthcare professional, or policymaker, this guide will provide you with insights into the methodologies employed by the Wastewater Genomics Syndicate.

Thank you for your interest in our work. We are committed to advancing the understanding of communicable diseases through innovative surveillance methods, and this documentation aims to facilitate your engagement with our research findings.
