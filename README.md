The Wastewater Genomics Syndicate at the National Institute for Communicable Diseasesâ€™ Centre for Vaccines and Immunology (CVI) in South Africa conducts surveillance of various pathogens, including SARS-Cov-2, measles, rubella, hepatitis A, hepatitis E, polio, influenza A, and influenza B, using wastewater-based epidemiology and genomic techniques. Additionally, clinical data is gathered from patients in selected reference hospitals as part of this comprehensive surveillance initiative. The information generated through this surveillance program serves as a valuable resource, offering regular updates on the trends and impact associated with the monitored pathogens. These updates are made accessible to the public, the broader medical community, healthcare practitioners, and policymakers. This documentation page is intended to serve as a reference guide, outlining the procedures for conducting analyses routinely performed in our reporting and publications.
